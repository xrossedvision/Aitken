/**
 * Open-ended, hysteresis-based segment detector (T5) — the novel core the
 * whole Luna redesign depends on. No fixed duration ceiling.
 *
 * Consumes a short (spike-triggering, ~200ms) and a long (sustained-
 * roughness, tens of seconds) [RollingStats] window; either reading above
 * its own threshold counts as signal. This is what lets a brief smooth lull
 * inside a long rough stretch keep the segment open even when the short
 * window alone would momentarily read "quiet" — the long window still
 * remembers the recent roughness.
 *
 * Peak-M and RMS-M accumulate only over signal-true samples — quiet
 * in-segment lulls and the trailing hysteresis quiet-tail never drag the
 * reported magnitude down. Duration is measured to the last signal-true
 * sample, excluding that same quiet tail, on both a natural close and a
 * forced one (`endSession`).
 *
 * [shortStdThreshold], [longStdThreshold], [endQuietMs], and
 * [minSegmentDurationMs] are `[CALIBRATE]` — placeholders pending real ride
 * data, not derived from any audited session. The default window sizes
 * assume a ~100Hz sample rate (20 samples ~= 200ms, 3000 samples ~= 30s).
 *
 * [shortStdThreshold] and [longStdThreshold] in particular should come from
 * [NoiseFloorCalibrator], not a hand-picked number — a guessed absolute
 * threshold doesn't transfer across phone mounts, vehicles, or road
 * surfaces, and would quietly skew which bumps count as signal across the
 * dataset.
 *
 * [gravityBaselineMs2] anchors [peakM]/[rmsM] to *deviation from resting
 * gravity*, not raw magnitude — ride-data-analysis-update.md §5's confirmed
 * bug: tracking `abs(verticalM)` instead of `abs(verticalM -
 * gravityBaselineMs2)` misattributes the peak to whichever sample has the
 * largest raw magnitude, which silently favors an ordinary positive-side
 * spike over a genuinely larger negative-side swing (a sample well below
 * zero can have a *smaller* `abs(vertical)` than a merely-average positive
 * one, even though its true deviation from gravity is the bigger event) —
 * measured at a ~25% segment-misattribution rate across three real ride
 * sessions. [Severity.severityOf] must consume the resulting [peakM]
 * directly as-is; it is already a deviation, not a raw magnitude needing a
 * second gravity subtraction.
